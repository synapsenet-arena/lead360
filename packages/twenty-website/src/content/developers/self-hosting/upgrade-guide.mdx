## General guidelines 

Always make sure to backup your database before starting the upgrade process.

## If you used Docker Compose

1. In a terminal, on the host where Twenty is running, turn off Twenty: `docker compose down`

2. Upgrade the version by changing the `TAG` value in the .env file near your docker-compose.

3. Bring Twenty back online with `docker-compose up -d`
 
## Data Migration

Migrating a CRM is a bit trickier than migrating a traditional software, because the data model of Standard Object has to evolve smoothly along your custom objects.

## v0.21.0 to v0.22.0

Run the following commands:

```
yarn database:migrate:prod 
yarn command:prod workspace:sync-metadata -f 
yarn command:prod upgrade-0.22
```

The `yarn database:migrate:prod` command will apply the migrations to the Database.  
The `yarn command:prod workspace:sync-metadata -f` command will sync the definition of standard objects to the metadata tables and apply to required migrations to existing workspaces.  
The `yarn command:prod upgrade-0.22` command will apply specific data transformations to adapt to the new object defaultRequestInstrumentationOptions.
